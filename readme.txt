The most advanced frontend drag & drop page builder. Create high-end, pixel perfect websites at record speeds. Any theme, any page, any design.

== Description ==

Elementor is a drag and drop frontend page builder that gives you the power to design stunning page designs in an intuitive & lightweight interface. With Elementor, we set out to create a unique page builder, that offers 3 features we consider crucial, and which no other page builder has:

**Instant drag and drop.** The most frustrating thing about drag and drop, is the lag that occurs after the drop. We created the elementor so all dragging and dropping is perfect. No lags. No Jumps.

**Advanced design effects.** Create pages that have "the designer touch", by including features like parallax scroll, full width background images, advanced buttons, custom headers, slide in forms and more.

**Responsive design.** No designer should work twice on the same page. With Elementor, there's no need to create a separate version for mobile. This saves half the work and still results in 100% responsive design.

**Other features**

* Works on the Frontend. Never again work on the backend and guess what the frontend will look like. With Elementor, you edit the site and simultaneously see how the exact site looks like.
* Gives total control with no hassle. We worked hard to create the perfect balance between full design capabilities and an intuitive and clean interface.
* Compatible to any design element. Include any element in your page: HTML, images, videos, forms, tabs, sliders, pricing tables, maps, blog posts, social icons, etc.
* Works on every theme. Elementor works on any old or new theme. Switching between themes is no problem.
* Plugin Compatibility. Compatibility with popular plugins like Yoast, WooCommerce & WPML.
* No coding. You no longer need to use code, HTML, CSS or shortcode.

**RTL supported, multilingual and translatable**

We've integrated RTL and multi language support within the framework of Elementor, so you get a translated panel out of the box, as well as RTL typography support, and developer options to add even more languages.
